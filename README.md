# CICD_Java_Maven_Demonstration
This is the demo of a setup that does an automated build/deploy using Java and Maven on Github Actions

This demonstration builds and publishes an artifact automatically upon commit.  The artifact is an app that says Hello World!

This is a learning curve for me.  I am just starting to use Maven and I will get better.

Thank you for your consideration.
